## Translation Philosophy

This skill prioritizes **transcreation** over literal translation:

1. **Meaning over words** - Preserve the core message and intent, not individual words
2. **Idiomatic expression** - Use natural phrases that a native speaker would use
3. **Cultural adaptation** - Adjust references, examples, and tone for the target culture
4. **Coherence** - Ensure the translated text flows naturally and reads as if originally written in the target language
5. **Marketing effectiveness** - Maintain the persuasive power and emotional impact of the original

## Core Principles

### For Translation Tasks

When translating between German and English:

1. **Read the entire text first** - Understand the overall message, tone, and purpose before translating
2. **Identify the target audience** - Consider who will read this in the target language
3. **Capture the essence, not the structure** - Sentence structure may need to change completely
4. **Use native idioms** - Replace idioms with equivalent expressions in the target language
5. **Maintain brand voice** - Ensure the translation reflects the company's tone and personality
6. **Check for false friends** - Be aware of words that look similar but have different meanings
7. **Consider SEO implications** - Adapt keywords naturally for the target market

### For Copywriting Tasks

When creating original website copy:

1. **Clarity first** - Make the message immediately understandable
2. **Active voice** - Use direct, engaging language
3. **Benefit-focused** - Emphasize what the reader gains, not just features
4. **Scannable structure** - Use short paragraphs, bullet points, and clear headings
5. **Call-to-action clarity** - Make next steps obvious and compelling
6. **Cultural appropriateness** - Use examples and references that resonate with the target market

## German-English Specific Guidelines

### German → English Translation

**Common challenges:**

- German compound nouns → English descriptive phrases
- Formal German business language → Professional but accessible English
- German sentence length → Shorter, more varied English sentences
- "Sie" formality → Appropriate English professional tone (often more casual)
- German precision → English clarity without wordiness

**Example approach:**

- German: "Unsere innovative Lösung ermöglicht es Ihnen, Ihre Geschäftsprozesse zu optimieren und signifikante
  Kosteneinsparungen zu realisieren."
- Literal: "Our innovative solution enables you to optimize your business processes and realize significant cost
  savings."
- Better: "Our innovative solution streamlines your operations and cuts costs significantly."

### English → German Translation

**Common challenges:**

- English casual tone → Appropriate German formality level
- Short English phrases → Natural German expression (may be longer)
- English marketing buzzwords → Meaningful German equivalents
- Cultural references → Relevant German examples

**Example approach:**

- English: "Transform your workflow in minutes"
- Literal: "Transformieren Sie Ihren Workflow in Minuten"
- Better: "Optimieren Sie Ihre Arbeitsabläufe im Handumdrehen" (idiomatic: in the blink of an eye)

## Workflow for Translation Requests

1. **Analyze the source text**:
    - Identify the text type (marketing, technical, informational)
    - Determine the target audience
    - Note the tone and style (formal, casual, technical)
    - Identify key messages and CTAs

2. **Create the translation**:
    - Translate for meaning and impact, not word-for-word
    - Use natural sentence structures for the target language
    - Adapt idioms and cultural references
    - Maintain consistent terminology throughout

3. **Review and refine**:
    - Read the translation aloud - does it sound natural?
    - Check that all key points are conveyed
    - Ensure CTAs are clear and compelling
    - Verify tone matches the brand and context

4. **Present the result**:
    - Provide the translated text
    - If significant adaptations were made, briefly explain why
    - Highlight any terms where alternative translations could be considered

## Quality Checks

Before finalizing any translation or copy:

- [ ] Does it sound like a native speaker wrote it?
- [ ] Is the core message preserved?
- [ ] Would this motivate the target audience to take action?
- [ ] Are all cultural references appropriate?
- [ ] Is the tone consistent with the brand?
- [ ] Are there any awkward phrases or unclear sections?
