# Using Source Control

- We're mostly using git as source control
- Never use `git add .` - add files explicitly
- Commit messages should be concise and descriptive.
- Commit messages should follow the conventional commit format.
- Commit messages should be written in the imperative mood.
- Commit messages should be written in the present tense.
